VSD workshop - RTL design using Verilog with SKY130 Technology

This repo is the report for 5-day workshop on RTL design using Verilog with SKY130 Technology by VLSI sytem design.

## Introduction to tools
* **_SKY130_** - Sky130 process node and pdk(process design kit) are an open-source packages provided by Google and skywater for 130nm technology.
* **_iverilog_** - Iverilog stands for Icarus verilog, is an open source verilog simulator.
* **_GTKWave_** - GTKWave is an open-source vcd(value change dump) waveform viewer.
* **_Yosys_** - Yosys is an open-source synthesis tool.
These are the _open-source_ tools used in the labs for the workshop.
--------
## Day 1
First step is to import all files including sky130 libraries into the system. We import the files with the help of git clone. Next, to work with the tools, the tool flow must be clear.
The design flow consists of various types of files. These include:
* RTL design - This is the HDL(hardware description language) code for the logic which is to be implemented. Verilog is the most popular HDL used in RTL design and ends with extension ".v".
* Testbench - The testbench is code also written in HDL. The testbench instantiated the RTL design and observes its outputs for different input values to check the logic functionality of code.
* Gate level netlist - The gate level netlist contains the design in terms of individual gate connections as opposed to RTL design which is the behavioural code for the logic implemented.
### Simulation Flow
The iverilog simulator takes the verilog(RTL or netlist) file and test bench as input and produces vcd (Value Change Dump) file. This vcd file can be viewed using the GTKWave.
*Note: The iverilog simulation flow is similar for both RTL simulation and Gate-level simulation(GLS).*
##### Commands for simulation
Use the below commands for simulation and view the waveform with iverilog and GTKWave respectively.

        iverilog file_name.v testbench_name.v           //creates an executable file
        ./a.out                                         //generates vcd file
        gtkwave testbench_name.vcd                      //view vcd file in gtkwave viewer
Snippet below shows the terminal for simulation flow of a synchronous reset d-flipflop.
